Technology and Development Notes:

Framework: The website is built using Jekyll, a static site generator commonly used for simple, content-focused websites. It allows for fast performance, easy hosting (e.g., GitHub Pages), and version-controlled content.

Templating and Content: Jekyll uses Liquid templating and supports Markdown for content creation, enabling non-technical contributors to write and update content easily.

Development Practices: The codebase follows clear, maintainable conventions with a modular layout structure. Components and includes are used to promote reuse and consistency across pages.

Styling: CSS is organized and minimal, focusing on readability and accessibility without relying on heavy frameworks.

Best Practices: Accessibility, semantic HTML, and simplicity are prioritized throughout the design and code. The project is structured to be easy for other developers to contribute to, extend, or audit.
