# Why I volunteer
Our mission comes to life through the dedication of our volunteers. See their stories below.

These are all of the reasons why I volunteer

## Betsy Ruhe  
There are so many things our community and our planet need. I can't solve every problem but I can grow a tomato, even some apples.

As a teacher, I found the best way to calm an agitated student was to go for a walk, or help me weed the school garden. There's something about being engaged outside that clears our minds and helps us to think and process our feelings. It's a safe place to chat with friends I've known for years, and friends I just met.

It's a chance to build community, something we are all searching for these days.

So, why do I volunteer? It just feels good.

## A message from our founder  
Over a decade ago, I imagined turning a plain, vacant lot I saw daily into a place of beauty and peace.  
Big ideas take time—just like growing a tree.

We planted the orchard in 2021 and harvested our first fruit by 2024. Since then, we’ve added a berry patch and three raised vegetable beds. As a true community orchard, everything we grow is free for our neighbors—whoever they may be—and any surplus is donated to South Louisville Community Ministries.

We’re always looking for volunteers and are happy to work around your schedule. Be a part of something meaningful and chip in!
