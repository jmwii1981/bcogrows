June in Kentucky is when gardens really come alive. It’s a great time for harvesting, and if you’ve got your hands in the dirt, you know the satisfaction of pulling good food from the land. Across the state, folks are picking summer squash, cucumbers, bush beans, kale, chard, early tomatoes, sweet onions, and even the first new potatoes. But down at the Orchard, we’ve had our own little bounty to be thankful for.

This month, we were fortunate enough to harvest—and donate—a few special crops:

- Snap peas  
- *Basella rubra* (Malabar spinach)  
- Serpent radish, also called “rat-tail” radish (*Raphanus sativus* var. *caudatus*)

### Taste Notes

- **Malabar Spinach (*Basella rubra*)**: This striking red-stemmed vine isn’t a true spinach, but it sure holds its own in a hot-weather garden. The deep green leaves and vibrant stems add color to the plate, and the flavor is mild with hints of citrus and pepper. Cooked, it becomes tender and slightly silky—perfect for stir-fries, soups, or stews. The red stems hold their color when lightly sautéed, which makes for a beautiful and nutrient-rich side dish.

- **Rat-Tail Radish Pods**: These curious-looking seed pods grow long and twisty, and they pack a peppery punch. Raw, they’re crisp with a bite—sort of like a spicy snap pea. Cook ‘em up and they mellow out into something a little sweet, a little nutty, and still good and crunchy.

- **Snap Peas**: These are about as close to garden candy as you’ll get. Sweet, snappy, and full of fresh flavor. They’re just fine eaten raw, but hold up well in a light sauté too.

### Recipes From the Garden

And, here are a few simple ways to make the most of these fresh-picked ingredients in your own gardens. They’re healthy, humble, and full of the kind of flavor that only comes from food grown close to home.

There’s a kind of quiet joy in seeing a garden come to life, especially when the harvest can be shared with neighbors. We’re grateful for what the land gives, and even more so for the chance to give some of it away.

We’ll be back soon with more gorgeous photos, tasty recipes, harvest notes, and maybe a striking tale or two from the field. Y’all stay tuned and keep growin’.
