Hi, I'm Mya (they/them). I've lived in the Beechmont neighborhood for 5 years, and you can often find me in the Beechmont Community Orchard getting my hands dirty. When I am not there, I have a background in horticulture with a focus on sustainable practices. I adore learning new things and sharing that information with others.
