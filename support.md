## Food insecurity is real.
Food insecurity isn’t just about missing a meal—it’s the uncertainty of not knowing where the next one will come from. It means families making impossible choices between groceries and rent, parents skipping meals so their children can eat, and seniors stretching a single meal across days...

Every meal provided, every donation made, every hand extended in kindness brings relief to someone in need. When we come together, we turn hunger into hope. We build stronger, healthier communities. We remind our neighbors that they are not alone.

You have the power to make a difference. Let’s make sure no one in our city has to wonder where their next meal will come from.
